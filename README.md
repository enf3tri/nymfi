# NYMFI 
Our challenge is “The Smartest Water Experience” from  Oras Group. 
There will be no water by 2040 if we keep doing what we're doing today. So, we want to achieve the most efficient water usage rate by combining the data of the OrasGroup and our imagination. As you can see, time is running out. If we don’t learn to conserve, we will all be fish out of water.  
Water is one of the most important resources for the world.  


We developed an app to deal with water waste. Our project name is NYMFI which means water fairy in Finnish.  
We selected this name because we know that a life without water will be a nightmare, we will live a fairy-tale life by saving water. The nymph will provide us with this tale. 


I want to tell NYMFI application. 
•	Our first button is statistics. In this button, you can see the monthly and daily water consumption graph in different parts of the house. The amount of water flowing from the kitchen, washing machine, dishwasher, shower, and faucet of the house is shown on the pie chart with their percentages. Also, you can see the graphs of power consumption, flow time and average water temperature. 
            While producing these graphics, the data given by Oras Group has been analyzed with         the help of Python language and made to be processed. 
            
            
•	Then look at the shower time button! As a result of the analyzes made, it was determined that a lot of wastage was made while people were waiting for the water to turn on and warm up before the shower. In the NYMFI application, we have developed a system that will bring the water to the temperature you want when you click the "I'm taking a shower" button just five minutes before you take a shower. In this way, water will not be wasted, and we will save water. 


•	In warning button we will send some notifications about the problems. One of the most common problem in apartments is dripping water from the faucet. Some people don't care about this problem, but as you know, many a little makes a mickle. To counter this problem, smart faucets send a warning notification to the homeowner when continuous water flow occurs below a certain flow rate. As another notification, the repairman phone number is also forwarded. In this way, water loss due to leakage from the faucet is prevented. In addition, if there is a water flow situation with high 
flow for a long time, it is aimed to prevent possible dangers by sending a notification to the host about this situation. 


•	In the bottle button you are seeing the percentages of the amount of water saved at the end of each month compared to the previous month helps to fill the bottle. When the bottle reaches full capacity, the new bottle starts to fill. After you filled a hundred bottles, Oras Group would have a water well built in Africa on your behalf. With this project, we not only encourage people to save, but also big social responsibility project with the help of Oras Group. 


•	Then look at the learn button. This button provides access to educational videos about water saving. 


•	Let’s look at the champion cup button! According to the month, water consumption is sorted based on liters and the nymph of that month is selected according to this order.


•	You can see the notifications on the bell button in the upper right corner.
At the end of each day, the amount of water used is calculated with the data received from smart faucets. After that, the monthly average of these data is taken. The notification from the NYMPHI app on the last day every month is as follows: 
Monthly Report Ready! 
Your water consumption was down 30% last month, for an average of 5000 liters. You have earned five mor points in the race to become the nymph. Keep collecting points! 


•	Also, when the user enters the shower, it turns on the shower mode in the application. Afterwards, a notification is received by calculating how long the user has spent water and how many liters have been spent. 
Shower Peport! 
Your water consumption was down %30 last shower, for an average of 40 liters. Ypu have earned one more point in the race to become the nymph. Keep collecting points! 
 
 
 
 
 
Another feature we have developed is that we aim to optimize water consumption with the mode settings we put on the faucet. 
Three different modes are loaded on the faucet: 
 
The 1st mode is the toothbrushing mode 3-120-15 is the name of this mode. The purpose of this mode is to prevent the consumer from wasting water while brushing their teeth. In addition, 2 minutes, which is the ideal tooth brushing time, is kept thanks to the faucet. In the first three seconds, the toothbrush is wetted and the toothpaste is squeezed, the next 120 seconds are brushed, and the last 15 seconds are cleaned. 
 
The second mode is hand washing mode. 5-20-10 is the name of this mode. 
The purpose of this mode is to prevent the consumer from running wasted water while soaping their hands. In addition, 20 seconds, which is the ideal hand washing time, is kept thanks to the tap and the bacteria spread by hand are cleaned in this time. 
The soapy hand is wetted in the first five seconds, the soap is foamed for the next 20 seconds, and the cleaning process is performed in the last 10 seconds.With this method, instead of 35 seconds of water flowing, only 15 seconds of water flow and savings are achieved. 
 
The third mode is economical water flow. With this mode, the aim is for the consumer to do their work using water with minimum waste.
