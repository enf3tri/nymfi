##  Meet with Nymfi
 We developed an app and system to deal with water waste. While developing this application, our main priority was its user-friendly interface and widespread use. In our mobile application, you can easily access what you need. 

## Nymfi Champions
In the application, every user builds their unique avatar and joins the Nymfi Champions Competition. Every user will be listed monthly according to their efficiency and winners will get a full filled amount of water in Nymfi Projects.

## Statistics
In our Statistics section, you can see the monthly and daily water consumption graphs in different parts of the house. The amount of water in the house is shown with their percentages. Also, you can track every kind of data in this section such as a comparison of your data with your neighbors.


## Shower Time
In our application's shower time section, users can easily set their shower time and our system will heat the water according to this for minimal consumption. 

## Warnings
As a result of tracking data, our system can easily decide whether or not the does faucet is dripping. According to this information, the system will provide warning messages to users to avoid adverse conditions. Also, the system's algorithm will help the plumber to locate the dripping location. If the user has a problem with calling a plumber, our application will easily connect the user to the plumber.

## Nymfi Projects
In the "Nymfi Projects" the user will access the percentages of the amount of water saved at the end of each month compared to the previous month and it helps to fill the bottle. When the bottle reaches full capacity, the new bottle starts to fill. After you filled a hundred bottles, Nymfi would have water well built on your behalf. With this project, we not only encourage people to save, but also a big social responsibility project with the help of Nymfi

## Faucet Modes
Another feature we have developed is that we aim to optimize water consumption with the mode settings we put on the faucet. Three different modes are loaded on the faucet

# 3-120-15
The first mode is the toothbrushing mode 3-120-15 is the name of this mode. The purpose of this mode is to prevent the consumer from wasting water while brushing their teeth. In the first three seconds, the toothbrush is wetted, the next seconds are brushed, and the last 15 seconds are cleaned. 

# 5-20-10
The second mode is 5-20-10 handwashing mode.  The purpose of this mode is to prevent the consumer from running wasted water while soaping their hands. In addition, 20 seconds, which is the ideal hand washing time, is kept thanks to the tap and the bacteria spread by hand are cleaned in this time. The soapy hand is wetted in the first five seconds, the soap is foamed for the next 20 seconds, and the cleaning process is performed in the last 10 seconds.

# Eco Mode
 The third mode is economical water flow. With this mode, the aim is for the consumer to do their work using water with minimum waste.
